# C++ Projects

This repo is a collection of projects I have developed in C++ at my spare time during my undergrad in order to practice my C++ programming skills. Most of the programs here are relatively simple and are developed in nature to sharpen my skills. I do intend however, to add more C++ projects to this repo in the future as a graduate student and as a post graduate to further expand my C++ programming capabilities related both to procedural and object-oriented programming as well as taking a jab possibly at IOT or other embedded sysmtes. Repetitio est mater studiorum.

## Projects

1. GPA Calculator
- This program allows the user to calculate their GPA. The user can calculate their GPA in two ways:
  1. The user can enter all of their grades with the respective weights for each grade.
  - This option allows the user to compute all of their grades one by one.
  2. The user can enter the number of earned credits and the number of how many credits the student could have possibly earned.
  - This option allows the user to compute their "average" grade.
2. Trucks
- This program opens a file containing information about trucks. The purpose of this program is to develop classes, in this case two for a Vehicle and a Truck. When the file is opened and the data is read in from the file, the respective information about the trucks such as year, manufacturer, model, mile per gallon and towing capacity are extracted and are then displayed on the screen in the terminal.
3. Website
- This program prompts the user to enter their name and a short description about themself, which will then create for the user a simple `index.html` file, which the user can choose if they like, to be a starting point for developing a personal website. 
4. Carpet Area
- This program very simply prompts the user to enter the length and width of a carpet in order to calculate the carpet's area. Once the two inputs have been made, the area is calculated and displayed on the screen.
5. Coffee Shop
- This program prompts the user to enter the number of coffee(s), bagel(s), and donut(s) they would like to purchase and once those numbers are recieved by the program, the price for each is computed, the total price is computed, and the total price including the tax is also computed. This number is then displayed to the user where they now have two routes:
  1. The user pays a number that is less than the total computed number, and the user recieves an error message and is prompted again to pay a price that is either the same or more than the computed price.
  2. The user pays a number that is the same or more than the computed price in the program, and the user then sees a receipt on the screen with their name, the number of each product they ordered, the total price before and after taxes, the amount the user paid, and how much change the user will recieve if any.
