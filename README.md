# C++ Projects

This repo is a collection of projects I have developed in C++ at my spare time during my undergrad in order to practice my C++ programming skills. Most of the programs here are relatively simple and are developed in nature to sharpen my skills. I do intend however, to add more C++ projects to this repo in the future as a graduate student and as a post graduate to further expand my C++ programming capabilities related both to procedural and object-oriented programming as well as taking a jab possibly at IOT or other embedded sysmtes. Repetitio est mater studiorum.
